    "description1": "This project consisted in the realization of a poster to advertise a product developed in the discipline of project to \"free\" from flies. The product that was assigned to me was developed by my colleague Maria Brito Martins. The project \"5 Steps to Kill The Enemy\" is presented as a comic book manual that makes, through folds, the newspaper more efficient to kill flies.",
    "description2": "Considering that the final object is a newspaper of some kind and the goal of the project was to teach people how to transform the newspaper they have into an efficient fly swatter, the most important thing to convey was the need to fold and where to fold. For the first time I let go of the prejudice that a poster has to be something 2D and, with the same folds that would form the fly swatter, the poster gained three-dimensionality and the creases became the main means of communication.",
